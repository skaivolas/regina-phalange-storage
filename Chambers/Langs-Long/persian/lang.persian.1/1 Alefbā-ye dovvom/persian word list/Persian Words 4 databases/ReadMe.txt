I collected a data set that contains these data
1-Dehkhoda Dictionary (only items)
2-Moin Dictionary (only items)
3-word list of Persian spell checker of open office
4-fa.wikipedia's page titles (only words that they don't have space) for modern words that are not in data 1-2-3 like گوگل
I didn't change their original data but I cleaned them

Cleaning Process:
For all of data, I Removed  Persian numbers, parenthesis,duplicated words  and replaced (ي ك) with Persian's.
I made a column that is mixed of Moin Dictionary+Farsi spell checker of open office+fa.wikipedia's page titles and removed the duplicate  words and it has 382K words! I ignored Dehkhoda's data because most of the words are not common in today's Persian writing!

Download:
I collected them in excel file and similar text file.
