# Arabic stories with full vowelling

This folder contains Arabic translations of stories from the [Global African Storybook Project](https://github.com/global-asp/global-asp) with full vowelling (diacritics) as is conventional for short stories aimed at young children and beginning readers.

## Conventions

The text is identical to that in the main repo, but all _tashkil_, _harakat_, _shaddah_ etc have been included.

The text follows the paragraphing and layout of the original story to facilitate creation of parallel readers with Arabic text with and without diacritics presented together.
