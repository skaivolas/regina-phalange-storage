# GASP-alternates - Alternative orthographies for Global ASP stories

This repository contains alternative or experimental versions of stories from the [Global African Storybook Project](https://github.com/global-asp/global-asp) collection in a variety of different orthographies that have not (yet) been included in the main repository.

Examples of alternate orthographies are romanization (e.g. _pinyin_ for Chinese), transcription (e.g. into IPA), vowelling (e.g. for Arabic), and ruby text (e.g. _furigana_ for Japanese).

## Overview

Many languages have a variety of different orthographies that may be used in different regions or contexts. In many cases the most common version has been temporarily included in the main Global ASP repository, and experimental versions with other orthographies can be included here for those who may need them. These include simplified/traditional characters (for Chinese), Shahmukhi/Gurmukhi for Punjabi, and Kana only vs. Kanji+Kana for Japanese.

## Orthographies

The repo currently includes the following orthographies:

* `ar-diacritics` (_Arabic with full vowelling and diacritics_)
* `ja-furigana` (_Japanese with furigana_)
* `ja-kana` (_Japanese text in kana-only_)
* `no-ipa` (_Norwegian in IPA transcription_)
* `pa-shahmukhi` (_Punjabi in Shahmukhi transcription_)
* `zh-pinyin` (_Mandarin Chinese in Hanyu Pinyin transcription_)

More orthographies will be added in the near future.
